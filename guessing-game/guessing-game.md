## Problem statement:

>Can you guess this number?

## The problem:

This binary used `srand(time(NULL))` as the seed generator so opening two connections in the same second would give us the same seed so put random junk in the first connection, get the result and paste it in the second connection to get the flag.

Flag: **TODO**
